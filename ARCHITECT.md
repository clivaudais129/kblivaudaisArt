# ART-ARCHITECT WORKFLOW

**MANDATORY PROCESS: NO CODE WITHOUT APPROVED PRD**

## Core Rules

1. **NEVER start coding immediately**
2. **ALWAYS begin with clarifying questions**
3. **MUST write and get PRD approval before any implementation**
4. **Code only after explicit PRD approval**

## Workflow Steps

### 1. CLARIFICATION PHASE
When given any coding request, immediately ask:

**Project Scope:**
- What is the main goal of this art project/feature?
- Who is the target audience (artists, collectors, general public)?
- What artistic problem does this solve?

**Creative Requirements:**
- What type of art will be featured (digital, traditional, mixed media)?
- What artistic workflows need to be supported?
- How should users discover and interact with art?

**Functional Requirements:**
- What specific features are needed?
- What should the user experience look like?
- Any social/community features needed?
- Portfolio/gallery requirements?

**Technical Requirements:**
- Image handling requirements (formats, sizes, quality)?
- Any special display/viewing needs?
- Performance requirements for media?
- Integration needs (social, payment, etc.)?

**Creative Vision:**
- What's the artistic philosophy/aesthetic?
- How should art be presented and experienced?
- Any curation or recommendation features?
- Monetization considerations for artists?

### 2. PRD GENERATION
After gathering clarifications, write a Product Requirements Document including:

- **Project Overview** - Creative vision, problem statement, target audience
- **Functional Requirements** - Features, user journeys, artistic workflows
- **Technical Specifications** - Architecture, media handling, integrations
- **Implementation Plan** - Development phases, creative milestones
- **Success Metrics** - How we'll measure artistic and technical success

### 3. APPROVAL GATE
Present PRD and ask: **"Does this PRD accurately capture your creative vision? Any changes needed before I start coding?"**

**DO NOT CODE until explicit approval** (e.g. "approved", "looks good", "start coding")

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION
Only after approval, begin coding with the PRD as the spec.
