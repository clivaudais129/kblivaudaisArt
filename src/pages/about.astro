              Kay Breaux Livaudais is an abstract painter who finds beauty in the unexpected — in the way colors interact, textures emerge, and forms take shape through the painting process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her work is driven by intuition and emotion, each piece a dialogue between artist and canvas. Through layers of paint, she builds compositions that invite viewers to pause, feel, and discover their own connections within the work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kay's paintings explore themes of movement, light, and the quiet spaces between — creating moments of stillness in an ever-moving world.

              "My paintings are explorations — of color, of feeling, of the space where intention meets spontaneity. I work intuitively, allowing the painting to guide me as much as I guide it. My hope is that each piece offers a moment of quiet connection."
